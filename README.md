# ML2020-Lee-TaiwanU-homework
I put my solution to machine learning course by Hung-yi Lee (2020 spring) here.

This is an excellent introduction course taught in Chinese. There is more content on deep learning compared to traditional ML course, and more homework than ever.

My solution still need improving.
